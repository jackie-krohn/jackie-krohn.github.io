In order to reduce the potential for power distribution line related disasters,
sensing equipment can be attached to the distribution line. These sensors can read voltage and current in the line, and by transmitting this data back to a central location, an updated state of the power distribution system can be easily monitored. By being able to monitor locations of damaged or downed lines, quicker response and maintenance can be completed resulting in a safer power grid.

In order to promote the use of these sensors, a more efficient package must be
developed. Although the basic requirements for these sensor packages are similar,
individual specifications can change significantly. These changes in components can affect size, weight, heat generation, and required power. A successful sensor package must balance all of these aspects in order to work effectively.
On top of these component specifications, the casing which holds the components is vital to the successful operation of the system. This casing must take into account the many factors of the sensor package as well as environmental effects on the casing, such as wind and impact resistance.

The goal of this project was to create the casing around the sensor package. From
the start, one of the biggest considerations for the team was the shaping of the casing as this would affect both the ability to fit components inside and the likelihood of electrical sparking, known as corona effect, around the casing. Additionally, the material of the casing was important as it should be strong and lightweight without affecting the function of the electrical parts. Inside the casing, boards, batteries, and sensors must be properly arranged in order to limit unwanted interference between parts while maintaining primary functions.

The final proposed design consists of a hard plastic shell made of high density
polyethylene in a roughly octagonal shape. Within this casing the components are
arranged in a manner to limit any issues between parts. Impact, electric potential, wind, and clamping force testing were all completed for this final design to test its validity.
