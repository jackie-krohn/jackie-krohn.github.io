This project was a fun way for me to play with some APIs and unstructured data and then try out some sentiment analysis with finbert, a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text. 

Check out my slides to see what I came up with and you can refer to my github for the code.

For a quick look at the competition between companies producing NLP AI, I pulled out Google and Microsoft([major investor](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/microsoft-makes-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-openai#xj4y7vzkg) in OpenAI) to comapare their stated risks.
